          <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer who loves to code and build things. With a
            background in architecture and academic research in 3D printing, I
            have developed a profound passion in problem solving and
            implementing reusable algorithms in my daily work. For example, I
            developed a parametric model in python that customizes the 3D
            printer's material flow rate to create a porosity at the microscale
            level. By utilizing mathematical formulas to construct various rate
            of flow change, a variety of pore geometries can be designed to
            customize the structure's localized mechanical properties. The
            research has led to fruition as it was filed for provisional patent
            and received further research funding to support commercialization
            efforts in a 3D printing startup. I have since left the startup to
            pursue a new career in software engineering by attending a web
            development bootcamp by General Assembly.

            a rendition of the popular 2048 game built with vanilla JavaScript.
